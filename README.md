# Dark-and-Light-IV-Characteristic-Curves-of-the-Solar-Module-
Photovoltaic cells are used in solar modules for the process of converting light into electricity. This process utilizes the light’s photon that hits the solar cell’s semiconductive material to knock an electron free from the p-n junction. To maximize the output of this process, there are several considerations that must be analyzed. The purpose of this lab is to take these considerations and measure the total output current in relation to the light intensity, distance, and the angle of incidence of the light source.
